## Meeting 8

### Project work

We [implemented](../hangwoman/word_source.rb) the 2nd piece of the hang(wo)man game, the word source. For now we just ask the user to enter a word, later we can replace this with something more sophisticated like pulling words from an online source.

The current implementation is very similar to [typing in letters](../hangwoman/keyboard_input.rb) during play, except you can type in multiple letters instead of one. That also means we have to check multiple letters whether they actually are letters. We decided to use `each_char` which runs the block passed to it for every letter of the string. In order to keep track if the result we introduce a variable `is_a_word`, which we set to false as soon as we encounter a non-letter.

    is_a_word = true
    input_string.each_char do |letter|
      if ('a'..'z').include?(letter) && is_a_word == true
        is_a_word = true
      else
        is_a_word = false
      end
    end

Here's an alternative implementation that uses `reject` instead of `each` and the variable:

    result = word.split.reject do |letter|
      ('a'..'z').include?(letter)
    end
    result # => []

If result is empty then the string `word` only contains letters. As you can see the code is simpler but it's a bit harder to come up with this solution. It might also be harder to understand. Your choice :)
