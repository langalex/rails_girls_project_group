This repository holds a collection of meeting notes, homework and (in the future) code from our [Rails Girls](http://railsgirlsberlin.de/) project group.

The group meets every Tuesday 19:00 at [co.up](http://co-up.de) in Berlin, Germany.

We talk on our [mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/tuesday-project-group?hl=en). Feel free to join.
