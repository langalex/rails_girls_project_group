## Meeting 7

### Project work

Today we started working on our own _hangman_ implementation: _hangwoman_. The code is in the `hangwoman` directory.

We first collected some requirements (see `hangwoman/requirements.md`) and broke down the game into separate problems.

After that we started with the first one: typing in the letters for the game (`hangwoman/keyboard_input.rb`). The important part here is that the method not only reads letters but also takes care of filtering our invalid input like numbers and symbols.

### Homework

Create/find an [ASCII art](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII_art) hangwoman or something else to use for the game. Create ~10 versions for different stages of the game and save them in text files.

Sign up for a free Github account and look at one of the git tutorials available. Play around with git.

Look at the project code and see if you understand it. If you can save your code in git, then try out the following changes:

* make the method return capital letters
* make the program read two letters instead of just one
