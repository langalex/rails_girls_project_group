## Meeting 3

We again went through the homework. We used hashes and arrays, no in combination with `if` and `unless`, for example:

    if number > 100
      puts 'yes'
    else
      puts 'no'
    end

We discovered a few methods like [Hash#keys](http://apidock.com/ruby/v1_9_3_125/Hash/keys), [Hash#values](http://apidock.com/ruby/v1_9_3_125/Hash/values), [Array#include?](http://apidock.com/ruby/Array/include%3F) and [Array#max](http://apidock.com/ruby/Enumerable/max).

We briefly touched on _String interpolation_, the fact that if you have a String with double quotes you can insert Ruby code like so: `"the sum of 2 and 2 is #{2 + 2}"` and the result of the code will be insterted into the String.

We worked some more with Strings, splitting, sorting, counting and joining them.

### What's new

We started using Etherpad (actually the <http://piratenpad.de> instance) to look at code together on the projector. Here's what we did today: <http://piratenpad.de/p/juman>.

We started looking at methods and what they are good for. Methods have a name, take arguments (optional) and return a value. They must be defined like this:

    def my_method_name(an_argument)
      do_something an_argument
    end

After that you can call them:

    return_value = my_method_name('a string')
    puts return_value

The arguments we pass into the method (in this case `'a string'`) are then available within the method under the argument name (`an_argument`).

### Homework

1. Write a method that takes a String and returns the first word of the String.

2. Write a method that takes two numbers. If you for example pass in the numbers 4 and 5 the method should print `"5 is greater than 4"`. If the first number is not greater than the second it should print out `"Error."`.

3. Write a program that starts with the line `x = 5` (or any other number). The program should print out wether that number is greater, less than or equal to zero.

4. Write a method `prints` that works like `puts` by using `print`.

5. Can you come up with a way to return two values from a method (kind of a trick question - you can't but there are ways around that)? Write a method that takes two Strings and returns them in reverse order, so `def swap(string1, string2)` returns `string2, string1`.

6. Moar project ideas.

### Next meeting

The next meeting is next Tuesday, Dec 04 at 19:00 again.
