## Homework

A while back we created a program that converts school marks between countries. Take that code and turn it into a web app:

When I open the app I see two drop-downs where I can select the country I want to convert from and the one I want to convert to. In addition I see a text field where I can enter multiple marks (separated by comma or space or whatever you want).

After I submit the form I see a table with the original mark in the first column and the converted mark in the second column.

Bonus points: show me an error message containing a picture of a cat should I choose the same country in both drop-downs.
