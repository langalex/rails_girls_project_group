## Homework

Write a program that has a list of foods and knows whether these are good or bad (or really bad, neutral or whatever).

The program then asks you what you ate. Assuming your "database" has spaghetti = bad, tomato = good and pesto=good. When you answer spaghetti it will say bad, when you say tomato it will say good and when you say spaghetti with tomato it will say good and bad. When you say spaghetti with pesto it says just good.
