## Homework

This homework is all about blocks and how to use them.

1. Given an array of words print out the length of each word. Write one version of the program with `each` and another with `map`.

2. Take the program from 1 and write each word and its length into an HTML file so that you can display the results in a browser.

3. Figure out how to use `reduce` to display the total no. of letters in all words and write that to the HTML file as well.

4. Print out each of the words in a different color (in HTML).

5. Ask the user for the minimum word length and then filter out words shorter than that. Print out the other words in HTML as above. Write one version with `each`/`if` and one with `map`/`select`/`join`.
