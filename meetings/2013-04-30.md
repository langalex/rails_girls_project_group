## Tasks

Given 5 foods write a program asks you to type in a food. It then prints out if it's healthy or not.

    foods = {'pizza' => :bad, 'ice cream' => :yess, 'carrots' => :healthy}

    print "Type in some food: "
    food = gets.strip
    quality = foods[food]
    puts "#{food} is #{quality}"

Given a hash with good and bad foods, print out all the good foods.

    foods = {'good' => ['ice cream', 'chocolate', 'cake'],
      'bad' => ['carrots', 'salad', 'soy']}
    print foods['good'][0,1].join

    foods = {'good' => 'ice cream, chocolate, cake',
      'bad' => 'carrots, salad, soy'}
    print foods['good']
