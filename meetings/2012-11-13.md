## Homework

Here's some homework for the ambitious. We're not at school, so everything is completely optional. Some questions are a bit tougher than others so don't worry if you can't answer them all.

### General

0. Come up with a name for our group.

1. Do tryruby.org again and see if you can learn something you didn't catch during your first/previous run(s). What did you learn? What did you not understand?

2. Find another Ruby tutorial. Do that and let us know if you liked it and what you learned.

3. Find a website that hosts the Ruby documentation and look up a few methods you already know.

### Coding

Remember: to start experimenting with code open the Terminal (or Command Line on Windows) and run `irb`.

1. Given a list of random numbers, how do you sort it backwards? Write down the code.

2. What do you get when you add two strings (using +)?

3. Create a string with the text _McDonald's_. Create another string with the text _Robert "Iron Man" Downey Jr._.

4. What is a hash good for? Find 2 examples.

5. Create a variable `rails_girls` that holds the names and type of laptop (make something up) of all group members. What kind of data structure did you use and why?

6. Find out what the method `methods` does.
