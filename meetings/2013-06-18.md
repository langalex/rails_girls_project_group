## Homework

Change the calculator form in the Sinatra app to allow the user to select the operation (+, -, *, /) and adapt the Ruby code in `app.rb` so it actually uses the selected operator.

Here's the HTML to display a drop-down of operators:

    <select name="operator">
      <option>+</option>
      <option>-</option>
      <option>/</option>
      <option>*</option>
    </select>
